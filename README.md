# Metaheuristics

Implementation of metaheuristics and optimization problems in python

## Description
This repository contains abstract classes for optimization problems (class Problem), algorithms (class Algorithm), as well as metaheuristics (class GeneticAlgorithm(Algorithm), TabuSearch(Algorithm), SimulatedAnnealing(Algorithm), and HillClimbing(Algorithm)) making it easy to implement new problems/algorithms.
